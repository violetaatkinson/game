# game-project-no-plastic-sea-

This was my first game created in Ironhack.


This game is about a submarine that fights against garbage and also releases turtles from plastic. 
I wanted to create this game to raise awareness of the state of our oceans and what we can do to help.
When you lose, it tells you how many turtles you have released and how much garbage you have saved from falling into the ocean, 
but I have also put a button that directs you to green peace to make a donation to help clean up the ocean. 

Hope you enjoy this game!!!!
